    <h3>Programs: </h3>
    <h4>VIM </h4>
    <p>Vim  is  a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi.  It can be used to edit all kinds of plain text.  It
       is especially useful for editing programs.

       There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi windows and buffers,  syntax  highlighting,
       command line editing, filename completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc..</p>

    <h4>nmap</h4>
    <p>Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed
       to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in
       novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version)
       those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
       filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security
       audits, many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory,
       managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.</p>
    <blockquote>

    <h4>tshark</h4>
    <p>TShark is a network protocol analyzer.  It lets you capture packet data from a live network, or read packets
       from a previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the standard output
       or writing the packets to a file.  TShark's native capture file format is pcapng format, which is also the
       format used by wireshark and various other tools.
</p>
<p>Without any options set, TShark will work much like tcpdump.  It will use the pcap library to capture traffic
       from the first available network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for each
       received packet.</p>
    <h4>mutt</h4>
    <p>Mutt is a small but very powerful text based program for reading and sending electronic mail under unix operating systems, including support for color terminals, MIME, OpenPGP, and a threaded sorting mode.</p>

    <p> PhotoRec  is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and ar‐
       chives from Hard Disks and CDRom and lost pictures (Photo Recovery)  from  digital  camera  memory.  PhotoRec
       ignores  the  filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so it'll work even if your media's filesystem is
       severely damaged or formatted. PhotoRec is safe to use, it will never attempt to write to the drive or memory
       support you are about to recover lost data from.</p>
    <h4>stacer</h4>
    <p>Stacer is an open source system optimizer and application monitor that helps users to manage entire system with different aspects, its an all in one system utility.</p>
    <h4>xdotool</h4>
    <p>xdotool lets you programmatically (or manually) simulate keyboard input and mouse activity, move and resize
       windows, etc. It does this using X11's XTEST extension and other Xlib functions.</p>
    <h4>ffmpeg</h4>
    <p>ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from a live audio/video source. It can
       also convert between arbitrary sample rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.
<br></br>
       ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be regular files, pipes, network streams,
       grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the "-i" option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output "files",
       which are specified by a plain output url. Anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as
       an option is considered to be an output url.
<br></br>
       Each input or output url can, in principle, contain any number of streams of different types
       (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The allowed number and/or types of streams may be limited by the
       container format. Selecting which streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done
       automatically or with the "-map" option.
<br></br>
       To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices (0-based). E.g.  the first input file is 0,
       the second is 1, etc. Similarly, streams within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g. "2:3" refers to
       the fourth stream in the third input file.
<br></br>
       As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified file. Therefore, order is important, and you can
       have the same option on the command line multiple times. Each occurrence is then applied to the next input or
       output file.  Exceptions from this rule are the global options (e.g. verbosity level), which should be
       specified first.</p>

       include customizable functions, units, arbitrary precision using a one-line fault-tolerant expression  entry.
       qalc is the command line version of Qalculate.</p>
    <h4>htop</h4>
    <p>Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.

       It  is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see all the processes
       running on the system, along with their full command lines, as well  as  viewing  them  as  a  process  tree,
       selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at once.</p>
    <h4>lshw</h4>
    <p>lshw is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware configuration of  the  machine.  It  can
       report  exact  memory  configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache
       configuration, bus speed, etc.</p>
    <h4>scrot</h4>
    <p>scrot  is  a  screen  capture  utility  using the imlib2 library to acquire and save images.  scrot has a few
       options, detailed below. Specify [file] as the filename to save the screenshot to.  If [file] is  not  speci‐
       fied, a date-stamped file will be dropped in the current directory.</p>
    <h4>xmonad + xmobar</h4>
    <p>xmonad  is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.  Windows are managed using automatic
       layout algorithms, which can be dynamically reconfigured.  At any time windows are arranged so as to maximize
       the use of screen real estate.  All features of the window manager are accessible purely from the keyboard: a
       mouse is entirely optional.  xmonad is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented
       by  the  user in config files.  A principle of xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance pre‐
       cisely the window arrangement that will result from any action.
<br></br>
       By default, xmonad provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide and fullscreen.  In tall or wide  mode,  win‐
       dows are tiled and arranged to prevent overlap and maximize screen use.  Sets of windows are grouped together
       on virtual screens, and each screen retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamically.   Multiple
       physical monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of a number of screens.
<br></br>
       By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich static type system, xmonad provides
       a complete, featureful window manager in less than 1200 lines of code, with an emphasis  on  correctness  and
       robustness.   Internal  properties of the window manager are checked using a combination of static guarantees
       provided by the type system, and type-based automated testing.  A benefit of this is that the code is  simple
       to understand, and easy to modify.

       xmobar  is  a  minimalistic,  text  based,  status bar.  It was originally designed and implemented by Andrea
       Rossato to work with xmonad, but it's actually usable with any window-manager.

    <h4>imagemagic</h4>
    <p>Use ImageMagick® to create, edit, compose, or convert digital images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, HEIC, SVG, PDF, DPX, EXR and TIFF. ImageMagick can resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.
<br></br>
ImageMagick utilizes multiple computational threads to increase performance and can read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image sizes.</p>
    <h4>nmtui</h4>
    <p> nmtui is a curses‐based TUI application for interacting with NetworkManager. When starting nmtui, the user is
       prompted to choose the activity to perform unless it was specified as the first argument.</p>
    <h4>grep awk sed</h4>
    <li>grep  searches  for  PATTERN  in  each  FILE.  A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given,
       recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By default,
       grep prints the matching lines</li>
    <br>
<li>Gawk  is  the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming language.  It conforms to the definition of
       the language in the POSIX 1003.1 Standard.  This version in turn is based on the description in The AWK  Pro‐
       gramming  Language,  by  Aho,  Kernighan, and Weinberger.  Gawk provides the additional features found in the
       current version of Brian Kernighan's awk and a number of GNU-specific extensions.</li>
</br>
<li>Sed  is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a
       file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted  edits  (such
       as  ed),  sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is
       sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

    <h4>nnn</h4>
    <p>nnn (Noice is Not Noice) is a performance-optimized, feature-packed fork of the noice terminal file browser
     with seamless desktop integration, simplified navigation, navigate-as-you-type mode, bookmarks, disk usage ana‐
     lyzer mode, comprehensive file details and much more. It remains a simple and efficient file browser that stays
     out of your way.
<br></br>
     nnn supports both vi-like and emacs-like key bindings in the default configuration. The default key bindings
     are listed below.</p>
